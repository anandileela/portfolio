## React Server Components RCE Vulnerability

**Assessment Date:** 2025-12-05  
**Organization:** anandileela  
**Repositories Analyzed:** portfolio, projects

---

## Executive Summary

CVE-2025-55182 is a **CRITICAL** unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting React Server Components. After analyzing all repositories under https://github.com/anandileela, **NONE of your repositories are vulnerable to CVE-2025-55182**.

### Vulnerability Status: ✅ **NOT VULNERABLE**

## Vulnerability Details

### CVE-2025-55182 Overview
- **Severity:** Critical (CVSS 9.8)
- **Type:** Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- **Attack Vector:** Network/Remote, No authentication required
- **Impact:** Full server compromise with arbitrary JavaScript execution

### Root Cause
Unsafe deserialization vulnerability in React's server-side "Flight" protocol used by React Server Components. Attackers can craft malicious HTTP requests that are deserialized without proper validation, leading to arbitrary code execution.

### Affected Packages & Versions
The vulnerability affects these specific React Server Components packages in versions 19.0.0 through 19.2.0:
- `react-server-dom-webpack` v19.0.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, 19.2.0
- `react-server-dom-parcel` v19.0.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, 19.2.0
- `react-server-dom-turbopack` v19.0.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, 19.2.0

### Affected Frameworks
- Next.js v14.3.0-canary, v15.x, v16.x
- React Router (RSC mode)
- Parcel RSC plugin
- Vite RSC plugin
- RedwoodSDK, Waku

### Patched Versions
- React 19.0.1
- React 19.1.2
- React 19.2.1

## Repository Analysis

### 1. Portfolio Repository (anandileela/portfolio)

**Repository URL:** https://github.com/anandileela/portfolio

#### React/Next.js Dependencies Found:

1. **api-app package** (`packages/api-app/`)
   - Next.js: 13.5.6
   - React: 18.2.0
   - React-DOM: 18.2.0
   - **Status:** ✅ **NOT VULNERABLE** (React 18.x is not affected)
   - **Note:** Next.js 13.5.6 has OTHER vulnerabilities (see Additional Findings)

2. **docusaurus-docs site** (`sites/docusaurus-docs/`)
   - React: ^19.0.0 (installed: 19.2.0)
   - React-DOM: ^19.0.0 (installed: 19.2.0)
   - Docusaurus: 3.9.2
   - **Status:** ✅ **NOT VULNERABLE**
   - **Reason:** Docusaurus does NOT use React Server Components

3. **main site** (`sites/main/`)
   - Framework: Astro 5.13.7
   - **Status:** ✅ **NOT VULNERABLE** (No React dependencies)

4. **Other sites:**
   - Hugo, MkDocs, Redocly
   - **Status:** ✅ **NOT VULNERABLE** (No React dependencies)

#### Critical Finding:
**NO `react-server-dom-*` packages found** in the entire repository. React Server Components packages are NOT installed, therefore CVE-2025-55182 does not apply.

### 2. Projects Repository (anandileela/projects)

**Repository URL:** https://github.com/anandileela/projects

#### Dependencies:
- polls-api: Node.js/TypeScript with Supabase
- No React or Next.js dependencies
- **Status:** ✅ **NOT VULNERABLE**

## Why Your Repositories Are NOT Vulnerable

1. **No React Server Components Packages:** None of your repositories use the vulnerable `react-server-dom-webpack`, `react-server-dom-parcel`, or `react-server-dom-turbopack` packages.

2. **React 18.x is not affected:** The api-app package uses React 18.2.0, which is not vulnerable to CVE-2025-55182 (only React 19.0.0-19.2.0 is affected).

3. **Docusaurus is not affected:** While the docusaurus-docs site uses React 19.2.0, Docusaurus does NOT use React Server Components. It's a static site generator that uses React only for client-side rendering, not for server-side component streaming.

4. **No Next.js RSC:** The Next.js version (13.5.6) in use predates React Server Components support in production and does not use the vulnerable packages.

## Additional Security Findings

### Next.js 13.5.6 Vulnerabilities (api-app package)

While NOT vulnerable to CVE-2025-55182, the Next.js 13.5.6 version has **OTHER known vulnerabilities**:

1. **Authorization Bypass**
   - Affected: >= 13.0.0, < 13.5.9
   - Patched: 13.5.9+

2. **Cache Poisoning**
   - Affected: >= 13.5.1, < 13.5.7
   - Patched: 13.5.7+

3. **Server-Side Request Forgery**
   - Affected: >= 13.4.0, < 14.1.1
   - Patched: 14.1.1+

### Recommendations for api-app:
```bash
cd packages/api-app
npm install next@14.2.25
```

This will upgrade Next.js to a patched version that addresses all known vulnerabilities.

## Monitoring & Prevention

### Future Protection Against CVE-2025-55182

If you plan to adopt React Server Components in the future:

1. **Always verify React version:** Ensure you're using React 19.0.1, 19.1.2, 19.2.1 or later
2. **Check for server-dom packages:** Run `npm ls | grep react-server-dom` to verify
3. **Framework guidance:**
   - Next.js: Use v15.2.3+ or v14.2.25+ with proper RSC support
   - Keep dependencies updated regularly

### Automated Scanning

Consider adding these tools to your CI/CD pipeline:
- `npm audit` / `pnpm audit` for vulnerability scanning
- GitHub Dependabot for automated security updates
- Snyk or similar tools for continuous monitoring

---

## Conclusion

✅ **All repositories under anandileela are NOT vulnerable to CVE-2025-55182.**

The vulnerability specifically affects React Server Components packages that are NOT present in any of your projects. However, you should address the other Next.js vulnerabilities in the api-app package by upgrading to Next.js 14.2.25 or later.
